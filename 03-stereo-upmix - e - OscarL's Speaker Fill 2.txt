# Oscar Lesta's take on Microsoft's "Speaker Fill" by Upmixing Stereo to 5.1 (or 7.1):
#
# To MY ears, this replicates what *I hear* the Microsoft filter does, but actually sound nicer,
# and the "code" is in the public domain (or under CC0 if your country does not allows public domain).
#
# The idea is to add some fake "spatiality" by replicating the FRONT (L, R) *lateral/stereo only*
# sounds to the SIDE (SL, SR), and posibly REAR (RL, RR), channels, while keeping the *voices* in the front channels (L, R, C).
#
# I also atempt to fake some kind of subwoffer signal.
#
# Alter this to suit your speaker setup by altering the gain/delay for Side/Rear channels.
# Spots for this are marked as "# [* gain]" and "# [* delay]", so CTRL+F (search) for that.
#
# Improvements could be made by adding some filters and delays according to frecuency bands, but...
# I don't have neither speakers or ears good enough for that to make a difference :-D
#
# Also, as is, it runs FAST. Even on my old Athlon II X2 it uses less than 2% CPU at 800 MHz.

  # The actual "magic":
  Copy: Center_Avg=0.5*L+0.5*R
  Copy: SIDE_L=L+-1.0*Center_Avg    # equivalent to SIDE_L=0.5*L+-0.5*R
  Copy: SIDE_R=R+-1.0*Center_Avg    # equivalent to SIDE_R=0.5*R+-0.5*L

  # [* gain] 0.75 works for MY setup. You may want to change this value according to your setup.
  Copy: SL=SIDE_L
  Copy: SR=SIDE_R

  # Try to minimize the "underwater" artifacts due to the "diff/phase" changes. This works for MY ears and test samples.
  # Using only one notch filter around 9 or 9.5 KHz greatly minimize the artifacts (depends on test samples).
  # Using two *almost* completely remove them (again, on anything I've tested).
